Hey guys!

I found some useful stuff for my Server-Client part on git. I adapted it to fit our project, but I get this thread error I can't fix. 
So any help is welcomed.

This is how I am thinking to implement Store Manager and Store interaction, using Socket programming.
 
Store Mode Manager creates a bundle ZIP Format
The Bundle is saved on Guitar Server and shown in store

This is when Store Mode Manager actually acts as a Server
and because the 'Guitar Zero Server" receives the bundle (file) trough socket it actually acts as Client

Bundle is shown also in Store Mode

Zero Button pressed and Currency check, bundle is purchased

Currency <- Currency - 1

Bundle moves from the Guitar Server (which here finally acts as a server this time) to Select Mode (Client)

The thing I am struggling with is passing a file between server-client without error.
If you get a error like "Address already in use: JVM_Bind", means the port is already used.
You can check on cmd with "netstat -aon"
You can easily fix it by using another port code.

So... yeah 
Any suggestion for passing file, or even better  multiple files trough socket between server-client is much appreciated

My contribution is in files: StoreManager, StoreManagerMain, GuitarServer, GuitarServerMain, E, MainStoreManagerServer
