Hey guys!

I found some useful stuff for my Server-Client part on git. I adapted it to fit our project, but I get this thread error I can't fix. 
So any help is welcomed.

This is how I am thinking to implement Store Manager and Store interaction, using Socket programming.
 
Store Mode Manager creates a bundle ZIP Format
The Bundle is saved on Guitar Server and send over to the  Store mode, when actually

This is when Store Mode Manager actually acts as a Server
and because the 'Guitar Zero Server" receives the bundle (file) trough socket it actually acts as Client

Bundle is then shown on Store Mode, Guitar Server finally acting as a server and Store Mode as a client

Zero Button pressed and Currency check, bundle is purchased

Currency <- Currency - 1

Bundle is copied from the Store(which here acts as a server this time) to Select Mode (Client)

The thing I am struggling with is passing a file between server-client without error.
If you get a error like "Address already in use: JVM_Bind", means the port is already used.
You can check on cmd with "netstat -aon"
You can easily fix it by using another port code.

So... yeah 
Any suggestion for passing file, or even better  multiple files trough socket between server-client is much appreciated

My contribution is in files: StoreManager, StoreManagerMain, GuitarServer, GuitarServerMain, E, MainStoreManagerServer
